            <p>
              In the event that a dispute or controversy among members,
              directors, officers, committee members or volunteers of the
              Corporation arising out of or related to the articles or{' '}
              <span class="nowrap">by-laws,</span> or out of any aspect of the
              operations of the Corporation is not resolved in private meetings
              between the parties then without prejudice to or in any other way
              derogating from the rights of the members, directors, officers,
              committee members, employees or volunteers of the Corporation as
              set out in the articles, <span class="nowrap">by-laws</span> or
              the Act, and as an alternative to such person instituting a law
              suit or legal action, such dispute or controversy shall be settled
              by a process of dispute resolution as follows:
            </p>
            <ul class="indent1 lst-spcd mrgn-lft-lg ">
              <li>
                The dispute or controversy shall first be submitted to a panel
                of mediators whereby the one party appoints one mediator, the
                other party (or if applicable the board of the Corporation)
                appoints one mediator, and the two mediators so appointed
                jointly appoint a third mediator. The three mediators will then
                meet with the parties in question in an attempt to mediate a
                resolution between the parties.
              </li>
              <li>
                The number of mediators may be reduced from three to one or two
                upon agreement of the parties.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the parties are not successful in resolving the dispute
                through mediation, then the parties agree that the dispute shall
                be settled by arbitration before a single arbitrator, who shall
                not be any one of the mediators referred to above, in accordance
                with the provincial or territorial legislation governing
                domestic arbitrations in force in the province or territory
                where the registered office of the Corporation is situated or as
                otherwise agreed upon by the parties to the dispute. The parties
                agree that all proceedings relating to arbitration shall be kept
                confidential and there shall be no disclosure of any kind. The
                decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and shall
                not be subject to appeal on a question of fact, law or mixed
                fact and law.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              All costs of the mediators appointed in accordance with this
              section shall be borne equally by the parties to the dispute or
              the controversy. All costs of the arbitrators appointed in
              accordance with this section shall be borne by such parties as may
              be determined by the arbitrators.

              Subject to the articles, the board of directors may, by
              resolution, make, amend or repeal any{' '}
              <span class="nowrap">by-laws</span> that regulate the activities
              or affairs of the Corporation. Any such{' '}
              <span class="nowrap">by-law,</span> amendment or repeal shall be
              effective from the date of the resolution of directors until the
              next meeting of members where it may be confirmed, rejected or
              amended by the members by ordinary resolution. If the{' '}
              <span class="nowrap">by-law,</span> amendment or repeal is
              confirmed or confirmed as amended by the members it remains
              effective in the form in which it was confirmed. The{' '}

              have effect if it is not submitted to the members at the next
              meeting of members or if it is rejected by the members at the
              meeting.

              This section does not apply to a{' '}

              resolution of the members according to subsection&nbsp;197(1)
              (fundamental change) of the Act because such{' '}
              <span class="nowrap">by-law</span> amendments or repeals are only
              effective when confirmed by members.
